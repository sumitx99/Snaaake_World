## Features

- **Pause/Resume**: Press `P` to pause and resume the game.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** difficulty levels.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy a beep sound when the snake eats a fruit.
- **High Score**: The game saves the highest score in a file named `highscore.txt`.

## How to Play

1. Use arrow keys to move the snake.
2. Press `P` to pause and resume the game.
3. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's body.
4. Eat fruits (`F`) to grow the snake and increase your score.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its body.

## Prerequisites

- **g++ Compiler** (for compiling C++ code):
  - If you are on **Windows**, you can install **MinGW** or **TDM-GCC** to get the `g++` compiler.
  - On **Linux/Mac**, you likely have `g++` installed by default.
